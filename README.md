## Project List

This section provides a declaration and brief overview of each individual project or assignment included in this repository. Each project resides in its own dedicated folder.

---

### **1. Project Name (e.g., `01_GPIO_LED_Blink`)**
* **Purpose:** A foundational project demonstrating basic General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) control by toggling an LED on and off. It serves as a "Hello World" for the ATmega32.
* **Key Concepts:** Digital output, delays, basic microcontroller programming structure.
* **Folder:** `01_GPIO_LED_Blink/` (or similar)
* **Status:** Complete / In Progress (Optional)

---

### **2. Project Name (e.g., `02_UART_Echo`)**
* **Purpose:** Implements Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) communication, allowing the ATmega32 to receive characters from a serial terminal and echo them back.
* **Key Concepts:** Serial communication, baud rate configuration, transmit and receive buffers.
* **Folder:** `02_UART_Echo/` (or similar)
* **Status:** Complete / In Progress (Optional)

---

### **3. Project Name (e.g., `03_ADC_Temperature_Sensor`)**
* **Purpose:** Demonstrates the use of the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to read analog voltage from a temperature sensor (e.g., LM35) and convert it into a digital value, possibly displaying it on an LCD or sending it via UART.
* **Key Concepts:** Analog-to-digital conversion, voltage reference, single conversion mode, sensor interfacing.
* **Folder:** `03_ADC_Temperature_Sensor/` (or similar)
* **Status:** Complete / In Progress (Optional)
